/// Live status of the macOS Bluetooth-debug configuration profile
/// (`Bluetooth_macOS.mobileconfig`).
///
/// The profile is installed system-wide and grants PacketLogger the
/// entitlements it needs to capture private BLE HID traffic from the
/// Siri Remote. Without it PacketLogger still runs, the helper still
/// thinks everything is fine, but `/tmp/iremote-window-live/remote.pklg`
/// never receives bytes — MENU / touchpad / Siri-mic all go dead.
///
/// **Two signals, one truth.**
/// 1. **Helper `profile-status`** (authoritative). The helper script
///    runs `profiles list` under sudo and greps for the profile's
///    PayloadIdentifier (`com.apple.bluetooth.logging`). When the
///    helper answers we trust it — `profiles` is the canonical source.
/// 2. **Behavioural traffic check** (fallback). When the helper isn't
///    installed yet, or it returns `unknown`, we fall back to
///    measuring whether the BLE pklg file is growing. Modern Macs
///    have BLE traffic from keyboards/AirPods/etc. running all the
///    time, so a 15-second drought is strong evidence that
///    PacketLogger isn't receiving anything (almost always = missing
///    profile).
///
/// **Restart detection.** If the user installs the profile while the
/// app is running, PacketLogger was already spawned without the
/// entitlement and won't pick up the change. We detect this
/// transition (helper status flipped from missing → installed during
/// this session) and surface a separate `.needsRestart` state, which
/// the menu renders with a yellow warning and a "Restart iRemote"
/// affordance.
